# Merge Sort in C++

This repository contains an implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in C++.

## What is Merge Sort?

Merge Sort is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that splits an array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together in sorted order. Its time complexity is O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- C++11 or later version

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumitksr/Merge-Sort.git
   cd Merge-Sort
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ merge_sort.cpp -o merge_sort
3. Run the program 
   ```bash
   ./merge_sort
